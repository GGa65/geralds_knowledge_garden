## Different Agile Frameworks

As of today I learnt, there are different Agile Scrum Frameworks available, the (my) company is looking to:
(1) [LeSS® - Large Scale Scrum Framework](https://less.works/de/less/homepage), see [[Agile at Scale - Summary - LeSS® - Large Scale Scrum Framework.pdf]] 
(2) [The Nexus™ Guide | Scrum.org](https://www.scrum.org/resources/nexus-guide), see [[Agile at Scale - Summary - Nexus™ - the Framework for Scaling Scrum.pdf]] 
(3) [Home - Scrum@Scale | Scrumatscale.com](https://www.scrumatscale.com/), see [[Agile at Scale - Summary - Scrum@Scale® - Scrum at Scale Framework.pdf]]  
(4) [Scaled Agile Framework](https://scaledagileframework.com/), see [[Agile at Scale - Summary - SAFe® - Scaled Agile Framework.pdf]] 

The company's perspective on all is, that the **frameworks** in general **need to be adapted to the company's operating model**. 

So, from a perspective of personal knowledge management (PKM) it might be valuable to look deeper into these frameworks with the indent to learn about the pro's & con's, the similarities and the differences.
